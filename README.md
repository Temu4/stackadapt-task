# Scenario

You've been mentoring a co-worker that's been working on implementing a campaign overview page. His last day was yesterday and he told you that he tried to implement everything but ran out of time.

Our product manager wants to ship this feature out within a few hours, and he needs your help to finish up the PR. He sends you a link to the PR and also attaches the below product user stories

## User Stories

- As a user, I would like to add todo tasks in a dialog that target either a campaign or creative.

- As a user, when pressing the dialog `add` button, it should mark any empty fields as an error. The dialog should not submit if errors exist.

- As a user, I should see my todos displayed with the task, campaign name, creative name (if applicable), and a `show` button.

- As a user, when pressing the `show` button, it should scroll to and highlight the targeted campaign. If targetting a creative under the campaign, it should expand the accordion and also highlight the targetted creative.

- As a user, I should be able to sort the table data by campaign name, budget, or impressions in either ascending or descending order.

## Problem outline

- Task 1: Find & fix bugs, identify & fix any UX concerns
- Task 2: Implement any missing features
